# I2M Mobile App v1.0.0 üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
This app was created by I2M, for our clients convenience. It allows you to submit a ticket to our system with ease and without the hassle of sending an email to the address that somehow everyone forgets... Likely, none of our customers will be reading this README but if anyone would like to use this as a template for your own company, as long as your tech stack is similar to ours it should be very easy to convert some of the code over. It is cross-compatible so if your running on iOS or Android it will work.
